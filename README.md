# ðŸš§ Road Accident Analysis using Power BI

This project presents an in-depth analysis of road accidents using **Power BI**, aimed at uncovering critical insights to support data-driven road safety strategies and policy interventions.

##  Objective

To analyze road accident data to:
- Identify trends and patterns in accidents over time
- Highlight geographic hotspots
- Understand contributing factors
- Derive demographic insights

##  Key Features

###  Trend Analysis
Uncovering shifts in accident rates over the year, highlighting peak periods and contributing factors.

### Geospatial Mapping
Visualizing accident hotspots to pinpoint areas requiring increased attention and intervention.

###  Contributing Factors
Examining factors such as weather conditions, road infrastructure, and urban/rural areas to identify potential causes of accidents.

###  Demographic Insights
Exploring demographic data to understand the groups most affected by accidents and tailor interventions accordingly.

##  Tools Used
- **Power BI** for interactive visualizations and dashboard creation
- **Excel/CSV** for data preprocessing and cleaning


## ðŸ“ˆ Insights & Recommendations
- Focus road safety efforts on high-density accident regions
- Improve infrastructure (lighting, signage) in hotspots
- Target awareness campaigns toward vulnerable demographics
- Monitor and manage road conditions during adverse weather more effectively
